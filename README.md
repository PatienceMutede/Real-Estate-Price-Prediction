# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
[PROJECT 1: Real Estate Price prediction (Random Forest, SVM and Logistic Regression)](https://github.com/PatienceMutede/Detecting-Money-Laundering-using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Detecting_Money_Laundering_Transactions_using_Machine_Learning_Algorithms.ipynb)


**The aim of the project is to develop an automated machine learning model capable of predicting Dubai property prices.**


**Motivation**

Dubai, has one of the most dynamic property markets in the world, contributing 8.2% to the country's GDP. In 2021 alone, the real estate sector recorded over 300 billion Dirhams in transactions, reflecting strong global investor interest and significant year-over-year growth. Machine learning has become an essential tool in real estate for analysing large datasets and identifying key market patterns. Historically, property decisions were based on financial, physical, and transactional data. However, big data has expanded the range of available information, allowing real-time or near-real-time analysis that includes economic shocks, shifts in consumer income, and broader macroeconomic changes—leading to more informed and timely decision-making.


**The Problem in the Financial Crime field**
In fast growing markets like Dubai where transaction volumes are high and property values fluctuate rapidly the need for accurate, data-driven price estimation is even more critical. With large amounts of real estate data now available, the challenge lies in identifying which variables most strongly influence price and creating a reliable model that can predict property values with reasonable accuracy.
The core problem this project seeks to solve is the difficulty of generating consistent, accurate, and objective property price predictions in a complex and dynamic market, and the need for a machine learning model that can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make better-informed pricing decisions.


**Objectives**

•	Identify the key determinants of property prices in Dubai

•	Develop an effective, automated property price prediction model.

•	Validate the model’s accuracy and predictive performance.
